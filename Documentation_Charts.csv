Task,,,Syntax/Process,,,Notes
1. Pie Chart,,,Populate Table & Create Chart,,,- Pie Charts are used to compare percentages of a whole
- Use SUMIF to populate the chart,,,"SUMIF(range, criterion, [sum_range])",,,- First populate the table that will be used for the chart
- Create a Donut Chart,,,SUMIF,,,- Cleaned Data Set a.k.a. CDC
,,,"('Cleaned Data Set'!$I$2:$I$109,A5,'Cleaned Data Set'!$B$2:$B$109)",,,"- The 'I' column represents the product line, and is the range"
,,,,,,- A5 is the cell labled for the product line for the first observation
,,,Select Data -> Insert - > Chart->Pie Chart,,,- CDC and the 'B' column is how many were orderd
,,,- Adjust the colors so that thy are not too similiar,,,- Absolute references are used so that thi sformula can be copied
,,,- Change the title of the Chart,,,

2. Column Chart,,,The numbers on the chart are being classified as the correspnding months for examle:,,,- Column Charts are used to compare data or multiple categories of one variable
- Use SUMIF to populate the chart,,,1 is for January,,,- The 'G' column is used for the months
- Create a Column Chart,,,Next the SUMIF function is used to populate the chart for the corresponding months.,,,- Now data for both the months and the amount sold is poulated
- Create a Combo Chart,,,"('Cleaned Data Set'!$G$2:$G$109,A15,'Cleaned Data Set'!$B$2:$B$109)",,,- Absolute refernces are used so that the function can be copied.
,,,"('Cleaned Data Set'!$G$2:$G$109,A15,'Cleaned Data Set'!$D$2:$D$109)",,,
,,,- Select Data -> Insert -> Chart,,,- Next the data for the Revenue colum is populated using the SUMIF function
,,,- Customize -> Series -> Sales Units -> Axis -> Right Axis,,,- Absolute referecences are used sot he function can be copied
,,,- Change to a Combo Chart: Edit Chart -> Chart Type -> Line Chart,,,"- Since the data between the two is the difference between hundreds and thousands,"
,,,,,,"- Sales Units can not be seen, the Chart will need to be customized so that Sales Units can be seen"
,,,,,,- The simplest way to ensure that both points are seen is to change to column chart to a combo chart
,,,,,,"- The columns represent the Sales Units and the Lines represent the Revenues, both by month"
3. Area Chart,,,- Selecting the same data that was used for the Column Chart -> Insert -> Chart,,,- An Area Chart shows changes in values over time and I meant to be able to call attention to those
- Create an Area Chart,,,-> Chart Type -> Area Chart,,,changes among multiple variables
,,,- Customize -> Series -> Sales Units -> Axis -> Right Axis,,,- Same process of adding another Y-Axis is needed here becasue the difference in the numbers between the Sales Units and the Revenue is so large it won't be seen otherwise. 
,,,,,,numbers between the Sales Units and the Revenue is so large it won't be seen otherwise.
4. Geo Chart,,,Select the data -> Insert -> Chart -> Geo Chart,,,"- The Geo Chart is used for data broken down by area, including ountry or region."
- Create a Geo Chart,,,,,,- I have taken one of the cleaned data sets that I had used with my VLookUp and Pivot Table portfolio to use  
,,,,,,"here for the Geo Chart, but I will only be using the countries and the amount of units ordered."
5. Gauge Chart,,,SUM(D2:D15),,,Populate the chart with data using the SUM function by going through each quarter from the CDC data set.
- Create a Guage Chart,,,SUM(D16:D34),,,This Gauge Chart shows the revenue for each quarter
,,,SUM(D35:D55),,,- The default setting for range was set too low and didn't give an accurate representation of  the revenue.
,,,SUM(D56:D109),,,"- I reset the min and max values to give a more appropriate representation (MIN 30000, MAX 200000)"
,,,Select the data -> Insert -> Chart -> Chart Type -> Gauge Chart,,,
